											<h2>About me</h2>
										</header>
										<p>My heart’s work involves supporting 
											individuals and groups as they
											grow to understand their potential.
											From teaching and tutoring to writing, 
											social justice work to nonprofit project 
											management, I’ve helped students and 
											team members reach and exceed their goals. <br>
										For the past 28 years, I’ve resided in San Jose, CA.  
											My wonderful family includes my son, my daughter, 
											and two pups.  When I’m not working, writing, 
											pup walks, hikes, camping, reading (this sounds 
											like a dating site write up….), cooking, music, 
											family, and dear friends fill my days.

									<h2>Tutoring</h2>
								</header>
								<p>Working with students is the great joy of my life. 
									In order to unlock their full potential, 
									students need tools and encouragement. 
									For young people grades 5-12, I’m delighted to offer strategies, methods, 
									and concrete practices which will allow them to be confident and successful 
									in and out of the school environment. For parents, being able to hand over parts 
									of their child’s responsibilities to me means they can experience the gift of 
									spending more enjoyable time with their children. Rather than always feeling as 
									though most of their time together is spent in managing schoolwork, 
									they can breathe a sigh of relief and happiness. </p>
								<ul class="features">
									<li>
										<span class="icon solid major style1 fa-hourglass"></span>
										<h3>Time management</h3>
										<p>Regardless of how talented a child may be, unless they are able to 
											manage their time properly, they won’t be able to produce their best work. 
											By allowing students to explore their own unique planning styles, 
											we’ll work together to create a system which is not only singularly their own, 
											but one to which they can commit.</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<span class="icon major style3 fa-newspaper"></span>
										<h3>Honing writing skills</h3>
										<p>As we know from our own personal experiences, being able to communicate effectively 
											through the written word is important (regardless of our line of work). With the 
											ubiquitous approach of composing on a computer, I believe some aspects of 
											creativity and inventiveness are lost. And yet, throughout at least their formal 
											education, they will be expected to write by hand extemporaneously. During a portion 
											of our time together, I will assist your child in feeling more confident in responding 
											to writing prompts. By practicing the art of writing by hand and off the top of their 
											heads or while responding to various articles, they will be preparing themselves 
											for future achievements. Sometimes I will ask them to do some homework by creating a 
											short story or writing about a favorite memory. In this way, in a safe environment, 
											I assist students in finding their own extraordinary voice. And whether I meet your 
											child as a fifth grader or a highschool senior, I’ll be ready to help them brainstorm 
											fabulous essays well before college application due dates approach.</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<span class="icon major style5 fa-folder"></span>
										<h3>Systems of organizations</h3>
										<p>With the innumerable platforms children are asked to navigate during and after each school day, 
											understandably they often feel frustrated.  Related to the topic of time management is the 
											concept of being organized.  If children can quickly and efficiently access the information 
											they need (from teacher websites, worksheets, online portals, their backpacks), the 
											probability of their succeeding is much higher. And the probability of their feeling 
											confident and happy is higher, too! As we work together, your child and I will construct a 
											set of habits which will increase their productivity and leave them time to pursue what brings 
											them joy. By finishing work in a timely fashion, they will also hopefully enjoy better sleep 
											hygiene, downtime, and routines which they will carry with them to college and beyond. </p>

								<p class="content">The process of writing has never felt like work to me.  
									From the time I was a small child, I’ve felt exhilarated, creative,
									and unburdened when I’ve put pen or pencil to paper.  Every morning, 
									I start my day with a journal entry -  a chance to reflect as well 
									as prepare.  Feel free to take a look at a few of my blog posts to 
									get a taste of my style and content. Stay tuned to see what else 
									might emerge.  I’ll be sure to update you here! Also, after almost 
									two decades of fidelity, I’ve recently cheated on my Moleskine notebooks 
									with Leuchtthurm 1917.  I’m not prepared to say at this point if the 
									current relationship will last, as it is a season of change, and there are 
									only 57 empty pages remaining. </p>

									<h2>Consulting</h2>
									<p>Since the age of 18, I’ve been immersed, to 
										greater and lesser degrees over the years, 
										in the world of nonprofits.  What a 
										privilege and honor it is to do the work.  
										Whether direct services to clients (in orgs 
										advocating for domestic violence and rape survivors) 
										or restorative justice research and practice, grant 
										writing, and workshop building, I’ve found many homes 
										to which I’ve directed my energies.</p>
